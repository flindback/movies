## Installation

This project runs on Bun instead of Node/npm, and Vite instead of Webpack. It works the same way, but is faster.
To run this project locally, you need to install Bun.

bash:
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
bun --version

terminal:
cd movies
bun install
bun run dev #http://localhost:5173/
